/**
 * Base class for leader contracts, with predefined roles for delegating governance authority and minting policies
 * @remarks
 * 
 *  * A Capo contract provides a central contract address that can act as a treasury or data registry;
 * it can mint tokens using its connected minting-policy, and it can delegate policies to other contract 
 * scripts.  Subclasses of Capo can use these capabilities in custom ways for strong flexibility.

 * Subclass and customize DefaultCapo's type-parameters if you need to customize further.
 * 
 * Any Capo contract can (and must) define roles() to establish collaborating scripts; these are used for 
 * separating granular responsbilities for different functional purposes within your (on-chain and off-chain) 
 * application; this approach enables delegates to use any one of multiple strategies with different
 * functional logic to serve in any given role, thus providing flexibility and extensibility.
 *
 * DefaultCapo provides roles for govAuthority and mintDelegate, and methods to facilitate 
 * the lifecycle of charter creation & update. 
 * 
 * **Example: Multisig authority delegation** - a Capo contract would get much more complicated if it 
 * contained multisig logic.  Instead, the governance authority for the Capo can be delegated to a 
 * standalone multi-sig contract, which can contain all (and only) the multi-sig logic.  Separating the 
 * responsibilities makes each part simpler, easing the process of ensuring each part is doing its job 
 * perfectly :pray:
 * 
 * A Capo subclass can decorate an existing entry from `super.roles()` with additional strategy entries, or can add 
 * extra roles useful in the operation of its application.
 * 
 * The Capo base class provides utilities for creating and using UUT's, or **unique utility tokens**, 
 * which are non-fungible assets that can form a positive linkage between the Capo (which should 
 * normally retain a reference to that UUT) and any delegate; that delegate is most commonly another 
 * contract script also referenced within the roles() definition, with a selected strategy.  
 * 
 * Architecturally, UUTs provide a simple and unique handle for the Capo to use as a  **required transaction element** 
 * in key operational activities (like updating the charter details); so that the delegate holding the UUT is entrusted to
 * approved the UUT's inclusion in a transaction, with all the policy-enforcement implicated on the other end of the 
 * delegation.
 * 
 * 
 * See the {@link Capo | Capo base class} and {@link StellarContract} for addition context.
