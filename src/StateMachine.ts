     * schedules a deferred transition to be performed when the promise resolves
     * @remarks
     * When there is a deferred transition, the state-machine will not accept other
     * transitions until the promise resolves one way or the other.
     *
     * A prime use-case for a deferred transition is for an onEntry hook to
     * defer (with setTimeout()) an unconditional next activity that will be
     * triggered by transitioning to the next state.
     * 
     * The displayStatus is used to provide transparency about the
     * implied "activity" of waiting to trigger the transition.  For instance,
     * a "doneCooking" state on a microwave might have a displayStatus of
     * "food is ready", with a 2m-deferred transition to "remindingReady" state,
     * where it beeps three times and returns to doneCooking for further
     * reminders (opening the door or pressing Cancel would interrupt and
     * prevent the deferred transition).
     * 
     * ### Return-type notes
     * Note that the returned type is not usable as result of an
     * onTransition hook or onEntry hook.  In onTransition, you can return
     * `this.$deferredState(...)`.  To use `$deferredTransition(...)` in onEntry,
     * just call it and don't return it.

     * Schedules the completion of a deferred transition, placing the

     * @remarks
     * When the context of a particular state-transition has a natural
     * affinity to a delayed effect of triggering a state-change (or to
     * re-initiating the current-state), this method can be used to
     * indicate that deferred effect.
     * 
     * The displayStatus is used to provide transparency about the cause
     * and context of the delayed change-of-state.
     *
     * The deferred transition will be cancelled if the promise is
     * cancelled or fails.
     *
     * A key use-case for this is to allow a transition that can re-trigger
     * the onEntry effects of the current state (or another next state), while
     * remaining cosmetically or semantically in the original state, deferred
     * the deferred entry to the target state; the target state's onEntry
     * hook will then be called after the transition is actually finished.
     * 
     * Meanwhile, there is an explicit block on other state-transitions, and
     * there is an explicit current displayStatus providing strong transparency
     * about the deferred switch to the target state.
     *
     * As an example, a kitchen-timer feature on a microwave might (once it
     * finishes its countdown to zero and is done beeping), trigger a 
     * `$deferredState("idle", ...)` with a deferred displayStatus of "timer finished".  
     * It would then move to idle when the Cancel button is pressed.  This example 
     * differs from that in $deferredTransition(), with the assumption that the
     * kitchen timer doesn't try to bug the user about it being finished,
     * the way the "doneCooking" state example describes. 
     * 
     * ### Return-type notes
     * Note that this type is only valid as the return value of an onTransition
     * callback, and not as a return value of an onEntry hook.  In an onEntry
     * hook, call and don't return the $deferredTransition(...).
